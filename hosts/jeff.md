## Background & Expertise

<!-- What's your professional background? What domains do you know well?
     What have you spent your career doing / thinking about?
     What lens do you naturally bring to new topics? -->

* Stanford Degree in Computer Systems Engineering (almost finished a minor in Philosophy). This is half computer science (minus a lot of theory) and half electrical engineering (but focused only on digital circuits).
* Most of my career has been spent in sales, marketing, and business development. My first roles as at IBM as a sales rep for AS/400s or iSeries computers. From there, I moved to Google to take the first BizDev role for the product that would eventaully become Google Workspace. At Google, I ended up managing all of the EDU  outreach for Google Workspace, before shifting to marketing to manage marketing and sales enablement activities for those products. My last role had me managing the go-to-market activities for Chromebooks in the enterprise and education sectors. My last role was leading Business Development at Upstart. 
* I have launched two previous podcasts. I still run What the AI?! - a weekly podcast breaking down the latest AI news for an executive audience. My first podcast was a fintech podcast targeted banking exectutive called Leaders in Lending. Both were sponsored by Upstart.
* I tend to think of my career as sitting at the intersection of new technologies and driving their adoption. I ended up spending a lot of time explaining new technologies to non-technical audiences and essentially translating between different groups. Sometimes that was translating from one technical group to another (such as translating AI accuracy metrics to traditional credit teams)
* I think of myself of myself as a generalist with medium-deep knowledge in a wide variety of arenas. I'm not a deep expert in many of them - but I  have knowledge well beyond casual in many areas - technology, business, policy, etc.

## Why This Show

<!-- What drew you to Backbone specifically? What do you want listeners to get from it?
     What's the question you're trying to answer through this podcast? -->

* I love the idea of Backbone for a few reasons.
* First, I think few people truly understand or apprecaite the amazing technologies our modern world is built on. We take so many things for granted and it's worth stepping back and appreciating them.
* Second, often technological improvememts seem almost invevitable - like they just occur out of a force of nature. I do believe there is an element of truth in that - particularly that once conditions are right it is almost inevitable that we will discover new technlogies. But that doesn't mean the discovery or desimination of those technologies is inevitable. There is so much interesting drama of how the world came to be the way it is that I just find fascinating. I sometimes wonder about "the road not taken" or what could have happened differently - and how different our world could be.
* Third, I love the personal stories angle we pursue. I think the people and personalities behind these technologies help bring them to life. Too often these figures can seem larger than life and 
* The question I wan to answer through this show is how did we get here? How did we build this world that we are living in? And who built it?
* I would also love to inspire people with the message from this Steve Jobs quote: "Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use."

## How You Think Out Loud

<!-- How do you build an argument? Do you start with the concrete example and work toward the principle,
     or start with the framework and look for examples? Do you tend to steelman the people you disagree with
     or challenge them? What do you notice that other people miss? -->

* I like to think that I work both from examples to frameworks and from frameworks to examples depending on the situation.  Fundamentally, I think frameworks are important because we need consistent approaches to important questions and topics. However, I think examples are the way we understand, pressure test, and refine those frameworks. It's too easy to get stuck in theoretical language lost sight of the real impact/meaning of a framework. This give-and-take between the framework and examples is critical.
* When I disagree with people I typically look for examples where I think their argument breaks down and ask them about those. I don't love to challenge them directly (I find it quite ineffective) and I want them to apply their perspective to see my perspective. After that, I might share my perspective on the example.

## What Gets You Genuinely Excited

<!-- What kinds of stories or details make you lean forward? What topics do you geek out on?
     What's your equivalent of "wait, really?" — the kind of thing that makes you want to dig deeper? -->

* New technologies get me excited - particularly when I see how they can impact daily work or life. I'm a total gadget hound and love trying out new services or devices just to see how they work. I'm also a total productivity nerd.
* I love histories and learning how and why things happened in history. I also love to get a flavor of life in different times - to really think about what life was like in a different time or place and to think about what it would be like to live in that environment. I think it helps me understand and apprecaite my environment more.
* Anything that surprises me makes me want to dig deeper. As I said, I'm pretty well-read and have a broad knoweldge base. My intuition for many thing is quite good. So, when something surprises me, I always want to learn more about it.

## What Makes You Skeptical

<!-- What claims or framings make you push back? What's your BS detector tuned to?
     Are there patterns of thinking or storytelling you find annoying or misleading? -->

* I am most skeptical of overly broad or ambitious claims. I think most issues are nuanced, most events have multiple causes and effects and stories that are too simplistic or sweepign in their perspective don't resonate with me.
* I appreciate story telling that both shows the uncertainty in situation and the nuance of them.

## Your Voice on Air

<!-- How do you actually talk? Sentence length, verbal tics, signature phrases?
     Are you the setup or the punchline? Do you ask more questions or make more assertions?
     How do you react when surprised? When you disagree? When something is genuinely funny? -->

* I've been told I talk a lot. I do like to back up and make sure I'm giving sufficient context for a story - though I often do it after starting a story or explanation.
* I tend to ask questions as assertions. I find people can give pat answers to a lot of questions, so I will often suggest a point of view (perhaps one I don't even hold) and get someone to respond to it as opposed to asking a more open ended question.

### Sentence Structure
* I alternate between short punchy anchor statements and longer, winding thoughts that loop back to clarify or reframe. I frequently start broad, narrow down, then reset mid-sentence.
* I self-correct in real time — I'll back up and reframe rather than push through a muddy explanation. "The way I think about this is..." is a signature move.
* I build on prior statements rather than starting fresh. I layer expansions rather than advance straight-line arguments.

### Verbal Tics (in rough order of frequency)
* **"Yeah,"** — opens nearly 40% of my responses. Almost always followed by an expansion, not just agreement.
* **"I think"** — constant hedge before any claim. I rarely assert without it.
* **"I mean"** — signals a deeper or more important point is coming.
* **"You know"** — conversational bridge; also used to invoke shared understanding.
* **"Like"** — used frequently, especially right before an analogy or example.
* **"Right?"** — tag question seeking alignment on a point I just made.
* **"That's..."** — restates the prior point as a pivot ("That's legit growth, real growth.")

### How I Open a Thought
* Direct agreement + expansion: "Yeah, I think..." (most common)
* Backing up to reframe: "Well, the way I think about this is..." / "Here's the thing..."
* Restatement to clarify: "It's like almost a third option, right? There's X. There's Y."
* Emphatic opening: "I mean, obviously..." (invites the listener to accept the premise)

### Analogies
* I reach for everyday-life analogies first (gym, Blackberry on the nightstand, homework), then business/tech history (dot-com, Google Search, Amazon, YouTube). Almost never technical.
* I introduce analogies with "It's like..." or "It's kind of like..." or "It reminds me of..."
* Examples from transcripts: sending a friend to the gym for you (learning via AI); Blackberry vibrating on the nightstand (always-on disruption); dot-com Superbowl (hype cycles); mechanical watches (demand for handmade in an automated world).

### Excitement & Surprise
* "I love that idea" / "This is pretty interesting" / "I didn't see this coming"
* I don't do quick punchy reactions — I build a narrative around what surprised me and explain why it matters.
* Genuine excitement shows up as longer expansions, not exclamation points.

### Disagreement
* Almost never direct. I validate the person and challenge the conclusion.
* Pattern: "Yeah, and I think..." then quietly reframe. Or: "That's not an unfair argument, but historically..."
* I use examples where I think an argument breaks down rather than challenging it head-on.
* Soft skepticism phrases: "I'm not sure that works," "I'm not sure it is," "The thing is..."

### What Sounds Wrong in My Mouth
* Declarative certainty ("This will definitely happen," "This company is doomed")
* Slang or social-media register ("that slaps," "no cap," "dude")
* Pundit hot takes — oversimplified, overconfident opinions
* Flowery or poetic language — I stay concrete and clear
* Academic register — conversational, not lecturing
* Agreement without adding a layer ("Yeah, totally, you're right" full stop — I always build on it)
* Written English in conversational format — I speak with natural repairs, dropped words, restarts

## Your Dynamic with Cyrus

<!-- How do you two work together? Who tends to go broader, who goes deeper?
     Do you agree a lot or push back on each other? What's the running joke or dynamic?
     What does Cyrus bring that you don't, and vice versa? -->

* Cyrus and I love to discuss and debate new technologies and ideas. I think we find each others' enthusiasm contagious.
* I tend to be a bit more cavalier about pushing into new things and just trying them and Cyrus is a bit more cautious waiting to see what happens.
* I think it's an open question on who's more technical. Cyrus has a product manager background while my career is mostly on the business side. However, I'm more inclined to get my hands dirty and play with new things even when they're not fully ready (sometimes writing code, etc).
* I think both of us are willing to push on the other's thinking and we both enjoy system-level thinking about how technologies will impact organizations, life, jobs, etc. We love to move past the "what is it" and talk about "what changes because of this."

### The Real Substantive Tension
* The deepest disagreement is about **institutional reform vs. disruption**. I believe good actors inside systems can shift culture — the right leadership, the right initiative, the right leverage point. Cyrus believes legacy assets and incentives make most institutions unsalvageable. Disruption comes from outside, not inside.
* In practice: when I propose fixing a broken system (school AI policy, grading practices), I look for lever points and engage thoughtfully. Cyrus asks who has the wrong incentives and why they can't change — and often concludes they can't.
* I tend to move toward Cyrus's framing over time. He's usually right about the structural diagnosis even when I resist the pessimism.

### Who Anchors, Who Explores
* In most conversations, **I introduce the problem or project and Cyrus probes it.** His clarifying questions tend to expose the assumptions I'm making or the structural issue I haven't fully named.
* When Cyrus leads, it's on areas where he has domain authority: venture dynamics, school board politics, market positioning. I ask questions and let him build.
* When I push back on Cyrus, I **concede or pivot without ego** — I'll accept his reframe and build from it. When Cyrus pushes back on me, he **justifies rather than retreats** — he re-explains the logic until I see it his way.

### What Cyrus Brings That I Don't
* He sees **incentive misalignment** immediately — when I'm frustrated at an individual actor, he zooms out to the structural constraint. He's usually right.
* He has higher **pace instincts** — he knows how fast markets are changing and gets impatient with incremental timelines.
* He understands **how scarcity and positioning work** as design tools — luxury mechanics, market fragmentation, exclusivity as a product feature.

### What I Bring That Cyrus Doesn't
* I'm more willing to **give institutions the benefit of the doubt** and find the reform path rather than writing them off.
* I'm better at **the human relationship element** — engaging with individual actors and assuming good intent.
* I'm more patient with **long-term compounding change** — planting seeds, building Overton windows, working leverage points over time.

### Running Riffs & Shared Territory
* **Tesla's design decisions** — recurring touchstone. We both notice when Tesla thinks in software vs. when they make baffling hardware choices.
* **Luxury goods as scarcity games** — Rolex, Hermes, Ferrari. We find it funny and fascinating how brands engineer desire.
* **School board absurdity** — shared exasperation is a genuine bonding mechanism. The incredulity about institutional paralysis on AI is real.
* **AI as a mirror for human limitations** — we keep returning to how AI reveals what humans can't do. It's almost philosophical.

### The Warmth
* We listen to each other's frustrations without immediately trying to fix them.
* We reference shared experiences, mutual friends, each other's personal projects.
* We use humor and self-deprecation freely — neither of us takes our positions too seriously even when we hold them firmly.
* Underneath the intellectual sparring: genuine affection. Every conversation ends warmly.

## The Waves You Drive Best

<!-- Based on the episode structure (Opening, Waves, Built In), what kinds of material
     play to your strengths? Entrepreneurial stories? Policy and governance? Human drama?
     Technical breakthroughs? Economic systems? -->

* I don't have a clear answer here. I enjoy the personal stories of individuals. I also love the "overcoming obstacles" stories about how a technology goes from a good idea to a successful product or offering in the market. I also love exploring incentives as I think incentives drive far more behavior than people want to think.
* Recurring hobby horses to lean into: the gap between benchmarks and real-world usefulness; how distribution and product matter more than raw technology; how commoditization reshapes competitive dynamics; outcomes-vs-inputs framing for regulation; "this is the worst it will ever be" as a forward-looking lens.
* I'm weakest on deep chemistry, biology, or fine arts history — I'll engage but won't have the same instinctive richness of examples.

## Signature Phrases (from actual transcripts)

These are phrases Jeff has used verbatim — use them or close variations to anchor his voice:

* "Yeah, I think the way I think about this is..."
* "It's like... [analogy]" / "It's kind of like..."
* "It reminds me a lot of [historical parallel]..."
* "I mean, obviously..." (before a point he thinks should be obvious but isn't)
* "That's [restatement]. I think..."
* "Right? Like..." (rhetorical setup before an example)
* "I love that idea of..."
* "It'll be really interesting to see what actually happens..."
* "I think there's a real interesting intersection here between..."
* "I'm not sure it is, right? There's this tension between..."
* "That doesn't make any sense. That seems like those two things are just at odds."
* "This is the worst it will ever be" (forward-looking framing on any new technology)
* "Product, product, product" / "distribution matters more than the technology"
* "When I use [tool], I'm not asking [academic benchmark questions]..."
