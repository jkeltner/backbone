# Episode Topics

## Pilot Candidates ⭐

Strong choices for the first episode—accessible, dramatic, not over-covered:

| Topic | Why It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| **Refrigeration** | Visceral "before" (ice houses, spoiled food). Strong resistance story (ice industry). Huge societal impacts (diet, urbanization, global food trade). Accessible to everyone. |
| **Shipping Containers** | Clear systems-thinking story. Fascinating resistance (unions, port politics). *The Box* by Levinson is a roadmap. Explains globalization. |
| **GPS** | Everyone uses it daily, few know the story. Cold War origins, KAL 007, selective availability controversy. Ongoing societal impacts (Uber, delivery, military). |
| **Elevators** | Counterintuitively compelling. Inverted urban real estate, enabled skyscrapers. Otis's dramatic safety demo (1854 World's Fair). |
| **Air Conditioning** | Reshaped where Americans live (Sun Belt). Changed architecture, productivity. Willis Carrier's story. Climate implications. |

## Evaluation Criteria

When considering a topic, ask:

1. **Is the "before" vivid?** Can listeners feel what life was like without this?
2. **Is there human drama?** Inventors, resisters, winners, losers?
3. **Is the diffusion story interesting?** Why was adoption slow/fast? Who blocked it?
4. **Are societal impacts clear?** Labor, geography, culture, regulation?
5. **Is it under-covered?** Has this been done to death elsewhere?
6. **Are sources accessible?** Books, papers, journalism we can draw from?
7. **Are we both excited?** If research feels like a chore, pick something else.
