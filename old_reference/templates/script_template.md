## How to Use This Document

This is the recording document—structured enough to keep you on track, loose enough to allow genuine conversation. It's built from the raw research and episode outline.

**What's here:**
- Scripted intros/transitions (read or heavily paraphrase)
- Key beats and talking points in order
- Specific stats, quotes, and details to hit
- Wave driver cues—who leads each section
- Anchor stories with vivid details to hit
- Mental models and analogies when applicable

**What's NOT here:**
- Word-for-word scripts for everything (unless you want them)
- Every detail from research (just what you're using)
- Filler—trust the conversation to flow

**Recording targets:** 90-120 minutes total | ~10-15 min opening | ~20-30 min per wave | ~10-15 min Built-In section

### Backbone Test: The 5 Questions

**1. Invisible?**
Has this become invisible infrastructure — something you only notice when it fails?

> [FRAMING for discussion: When did it cross from "remarkable" to "assumed"? What does it feel like when it breaks?]

*Brief notes:*
- [Key example of invisibility]
- [What happens when it fails]

**2. What depends on it?**
What systems, industries, or ways of life exist ONLY because this technology exists?

> [FRAMING for discussion: Map the dependency chain — what relies on this that most people don't realize?]

*Brief notes:*
- [Primary dependencies]
- [Surprising downstream dependencies]

**3. What's the hidden cost?**
What are we still paying that most people don't see?

> [FRAMING for discussion: Energy, labor, environment, inequality, fragility — what's on the other side of the ledger?]

*Brief notes:*
- [Biggest hidden cost]
- [Most surprising cost]

**4. Could we go back?**
What would collapse if this disappeared tomorrow?

> [FRAMING for discussion: How deep is the dependency? How much do we take for granted?]

*Brief notes:*
- [What would break first]
- [The scale of the dependency]

**5. What's next?**
What's still evolving behind the scenes? What does the next wave look like?

> [FRAMING for discussion: Backbone technologies don't stop developing once they become invisible. What's coming?]

*Brief notes:*
- [Recent developments]
- [What the next wave might look like]

### Open Questions & Speculations

**Question 1:**

> [SCRIPTED FRAMING of an open question—something the evidence doesn't fully answer, but is worth wondering about]

- [Where it might go next]

**Question 2:**

> [SCRIPTED FRAMING of another open question]

*Why this matters:*
- [Why listeners should care]
- [What it implies]

### Closing

**[SCRIPTED CLOSING—tie the episode back to the title/theme, land the point, send listeners off thoughtfully]**
