# Episode Research: [TOPIC NAME]

*Research compiled: [DATE]*
*Status: Initial / In Progress / Complete*

## How to Use This Document

This is the raw research file for "Backbone: From Breakthrough to Built-In." It's organized by topic area (not by episode structure yet) so you can gather material comprehensively before defining the wave boundaries.

**Key principles:**
- More material is better than less at this stage
- Highlight best findings with ⭐ to flag standout research
- This feeds into the Wave Mapping section, which then becomes Episode Notes and Script

**Workflow:**
1. Claude compiles initial research by topic area
2. Jeff/Cyrus review, request deeper dives on specific areas
3. All refinements get added to this document
4. Wave Mapping section identifies natural 2-4 wave boundaries
5. This structure then feeds into Episode Notes and Script

## Anchor Story Candidates

**These are the hardest to find and most valuable.** An anchor story is a specific, vivid, short-form narrative (named person, date, place) that captures larger dynamics in miniature. It should be:
- Specific enough to tell: person's name, actual date, actual location
- Representative of a broader theme
- Emotionally resonant or surprising
- Verifiable from good sources

### Candidate Stories

#### Story 1
- **Who:** [Name]
- **When:** [Date/Year]
- **Where:** [Location]
- **What Happened:** [The story in 2-3 sentences]
- **Why It Matters:** [What larger dynamic does this represent?]
- **Verification Status:** [Sources confirming this story]
- **Best Source:** [Where to read the full version]

#### Story 2

## Research Notes

### Claims to Verify
*Flag anything that needs fact-checking before use in the script.*

| Claim | Confidence | Source | Needs Verification | Notes |
|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| | High/Medium/Low | | Yes/No | |

### Contradictions Found
*Different sources tell different stories. Document the disagreement.*
-

### Gaps to Fill
*Areas where more research is needed.*
-

### Interesting Tangents (Parking Lot)

## AI Research Limitations

*Remember when using this document:*
- Claims should be verified against primary sources, especially direct quotes
- AI knowledge has a cutoff—recent information needs independent verification
- AI may present plausible-sounding but incorrect information confidently
- Different sources may tell different versions; AI may pick one arbitrarily
- AI can miss specialized knowledge, archival sources, and local histories

**When in doubt, go to the primary source.**
