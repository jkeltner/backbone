---

## Episode Status

**Target Length:** 90–120 minutes
**Number of Waves:** [2–4]
**Draft Version:** v[1.0]

---

## Episode Thesis

**One-sentence version:**

[What's the core claim or arc of this episode? What do listeners take away?]

**Key tension or surprise:**

[What's the "aha" moment or counterintuitive insight that makes this story worth telling?]

---

## OPENING: The Hook (~12–18 min, both hosts)

### Cold Open
*Vivid story, anecdote, or moment (2–3 min) that makes the listener lean in.*

**Scene/story:**

[Write or describe a specific, concrete moment that captures the stakes or drama of what's to come.]

**Why it works:**

[How does this connect to the larger theme? What emotional hook does it set?]

---

### By the Numbers
*3–5 impact stats that convey scale, transformation, or surprise. Not a list—woven into narrative.*

**Stat 1:** [NUMBER/METRIC] — [What it means]

**Stat 2:** [NUMBER/METRIC] — [What it means]

**Stat 3:** [NUMBER/METRIC] — [What it means]

**Notes on framing:**

[How do we want to present these? Which are the headline figures?]

---

### The World Before
*True baseline—what was the status quo before [TOPIC] changed things?*

**Scene/detail:**

[A specific, grounded description of how things worked before. Not abstract—show the friction, the manual process, the limitation.]

**What were people doing instead?**

[Alternative solutions, workarounds, accepted limitations?]

---

### The Road Ahead
*Brief preview of what the episode will explore. Set up the waves.*

**What we'll cover:**

- [WAVE 1 TITLE]
- [WAVE 2 TITLE]
- [WAVE 3 TITLE] (if applicable)

**Threading through:**

[Is there a common question or tension that connects them?]

---

## WAVE 1: [TITLE] (~15–25 min, Host A drives)

### The Breakthrough
*The key people, institutions, and pivotal moment.*

**Who were the inventors/pioneers?**

[Names, backgrounds, what motivated them. Keep it specific—not "scientists" but [PERSON] at [PLACE].]

**The pivotal moment:**

[What was the insight, discovery, or decision that changed everything? When and where?]

**Why it mattered:**

[What did this enable that wasn't possible before?]

---

### Anchor Stories
*1–2 stories that make the breakthrough concrete and human.*

**Story 1: [Title or Name]**

[Vivid narrative—who was involved, what happened, why it illustrates the breakthrough.]

**Why it works:** [Emotional angle, surprise, human stakes, or clarity on the mechanism.]

---

**Story 2: [Title or Name]** (if space allows)

[Vivid narrative—different angle or consequence than Story 1.]

**Why it works:** [What does this add that Story 1 doesn't? Different geography, industry, unintended consequence?]

---

### How It Works
*Only include this section in the wave where the core mechanism is introduced.*

**The mental model (one sentence):**

[How do we explain the core mechanism clearly and memorably?]

**The explanation (2–3 min of episode):**

[Build from analogy or everyday experience → the technical insight → why it matters. Use specifics, not jargon.]

**Diagram or metaphor:**

[Any visual or comparison that helps listeners hold the concept?]

---

### Diffusion & Resistance

**Early adopters:**

[Who first saw the potential? What motivated them? What did they risk?]

**Resisters & resistance:**

[Who opposed or ignored this innovation? Why? What was their argument? (Make it credible, not a strawman.)]

**Enabling conditions:**

[What had to be true for this to spread? Regulatory change? Cost reduction? Market pressure? Cultural shift?]

**The tipping point:**

[What was the moment or condition when resistance cracked and adoption accelerated? Specific event, threshold, or cascade?]

---

### What Changed
*Consequences of Wave 1 + bridge to Wave 2.*

**First-order effects:**

[What happened immediately after adoption?]

**Hidden costs or unexpected consequences:**

[Did this innovation create new problems, winners, or losers?]

**Bridge to next wave:**

[How does Wave 1 set up or enable Wave 2? What new question does it raise?]

---

## WAVE 2: [TITLE] (~15–25 min, Host B drives)

### The Breakthrough

**Who were the inventors/pioneers?**

[Names, backgrounds, what motivated them.]

[The insight, discovery, or decision. When and where?]

**Why it mattered:**

[What did this enable?]

---

**Story 1: [Title or Name]**

[Vivid narrative.]

**Why it works:** [Emotional angle, surprise, clarity, or new dimension.]

---

**Story 2: [Title or Name]** (if space allows)

**Why it works:** [What does this add?]

---

### Diffusion & Resistance

**Early adopters:**

[Who first saw the potential?]

**Resisters & resistance:**

[Who opposed this? What was their argument?]

**Enabling conditions:**

[What had to be true?]

**The tipping point:**

[The moment or condition when adoption accelerated?]

---

### What Changed

**First-order effects:**

[What happened immediately?]

**Hidden costs or unexpected consequences:**

[New problems, winners, losers?]

**Bridge to next wave:**

[How does Wave 2 set up Wave 3 (if applicable)? What question does it raise?]

---

## WAVE 3: [TITLE] (~15–25 min, Host A or B drives) [Optional]

**Bridge to finale:**

[How does this wave set up the "Built In" section? What's the culmination?]

---

## BUILT IN: The Big Picture (~15–20 min, both hosts)

### The Full Arc
*Total transformation. Revisit the numbers. Connect Wave 1 → Wave 2 → Wave 3.*

**The story from 30,000 feet:**

[How has [TOPIC] gone from breakthrough to invisible infrastructure? What's the arc?]

**Numbers revisited:**

[Which of our opening stats have changed? Which new stats illustrate the depth of transformation? (Avoid pure repetition—show how things have evolved.)]

---

### The Backbone Test
*Five questions to test whether [TOPIC] is truly "built in."*

**1. Is it invisible?**

[Do most people not think about [TOPIC] anymore? Can you use things that depend on it without knowing it exists?]

**2. What depends on it now?**

[What infrastructure, industries, or daily activities would collapse without [TOPIC]? What can't exist without it?]

**3. What's the hidden cost?**

[What do we take for granted or accept about [TOPIC] that came at a price—environmental, social, economic, or opportunity cost?]

**4. Could we go back?**

[If [TOPIC] disappeared tomorrow, what would we lose? Is there any realistic way to return to the "before"?]

**5. What's next?**

[Is [TOPIC] the end point, or does it enable something new we haven't fully grasped yet?]

---

### Open Questions
*2–3 unresolved questions to leave listeners thinking.*

**Question 1:**

[What tension or uncertainty remains? What are we still figuring out?]

**Question 2:**

[What could go wrong? What's the risk or limit we haven't solved?]

**Question 3:** (optional)

[What's the frontier—what's next?]
