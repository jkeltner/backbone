# Pilot Episode Planning Sprint

A checklist of decisions and prep work to complete before recording the pilot episode.

---

## Phase 1: Alignment (Jeff + Cyrus)

### Topic Selection
- [ ] Review pilot candidates (Refrigeration, Containers, GPS, Elevators, Air Conditioning)
- [ ] Discuss which topic excites you both most
- [ ] Confirm neither of you has strong knowledge gaps that would make research painful
- [ ] Final decision: **_________________**

### Format Alignment
- [ ] Agree on target length (current thinking: 90-120 min)
- [ ] Discuss tone—conversational with scripted beats? Fully scripted? Loose outline only?
- [ ] Decide on host roles—do you split sections, or is one person the "driver"?
- [ ] How do you want to handle tangents and disagreements on-air?

### Logistics
- [ ] Recording setup: In-person or remote?
- [ ] If remote: what software? (Riverside, Zencastr, Squadcast, etc.)
- [ ] Microphone/audio quality check for both hosts
- [ ] Backup recording plan?

### Success Criteria for Pilot
- [ ] What questions are you trying to answer with this pilot?
  - Do we enjoy making this?
  - Can we sustain the research workload?
  - Does the format work?
  - Is the chemistry there?
- [ ] What would make you say "let's do more" vs "this isn't for us"?

## Phase 2: Research

### Research Division
- [ ] Who researches which sections of the outline?
- [ ] Deadline for research completion: **_________________**
- [ ] How will you share research notes? (Shared doc, folder, etc.)

### Key Questions to Answer (for chosen topic)
*Adapt these based on the episode outline template:*

- [ ] **The World Before**: What was life like before this innovation? Specific pain points, costs, constraints?
- [ ] **Discovery**: Who invented/developed it? What were their motivations? What failed attempts preceded it?
- [ ] **How It Works**: What's the core insight a listener needs? (Keep it simple)
- [ ] **Diffusion**: Why was adoption slow/fast? Who resisted and why? What complementary tech was needed?
- [ ] **Winners & Losers**: Who gained? Who got disrupted? Who adapted fastest?
- [ ] **Societal Impacts**: Labor, urbanization, culture, regulation?
- [ ] **Numbers**: Key statistics on adoption, cost decline, scale?
- [ ] **Open Questions**: 2-3 unresolved issues or future implications?

### Source Gathering
- [ ] Identify 2-3 primary book sources
- [ ] Find academic papers or original documents if available
- [ ] Locate good narrative journalism or longform articles
- [ ] Note any documentaries or video sources
- [ ] Identify experts you could potentially reference

## Phase 3: Pre-Recording Prep

### Outline Development
- [ ] Create episode-specific outline based on template
- [ ] Mark which host covers which sections
- [ ] Identify key stories/anecdotes to definitely include
- [ ] Note any quotes or statistics to have ready
- [ ] Flag sections where you want genuine discussion vs. prepared content

### Dry Run Decisions
- [ ] Will you do a practice run or record cold?
- [ ] How will you handle mistakes? (Edit out, keep going, re-record section?)
- [ ] Set a hard stop time to avoid going too long?

### Recording Day Prep
- [ ] Schedule recording session: **_________________**
- [ ] Test all equipment 24 hours before
- [ ] Quiet space confirmed for both hosts
- [ ] Water, notes, outline ready
- [ ] Phone on silent, notifications off

## Phase 4: Post-Recording

### Editing (Jeff)
- [ ] First pass: cut obvious mistakes, long pauses, false starts
- [ ] Second pass: tighten for pacing, remove redundancy
- [ ] Add intro/outro (if any)
- [ ] Music/sound design decisions
- [ ] Target final length: **_________________**

### Review
- [ ] Both hosts listen to edited version
- [ ] Note what worked and what didn't
- [ ] Discuss: Do we want to do this again?

---

## Phase 5: Pilot Retrospective

*Complete after recording and editing:*

### What Worked
-

### What Didn't Work
-

### Process Changes for Next Episode
-

### Go/No-Go Decision
- [ ] Record more episodes?
- [ ] Adjust format first?
- [ ] Not for us?
