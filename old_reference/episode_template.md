# Episode Template

## How This Template Works

Most backbone technologies don't have a single discovery-diffusion-aftermath arc. They evolve through **waves** — each with its own breakthrough, resistance, and consequences. The aftermath of one wave becomes the setup for the next.

Some episodes will have 3-4 waves (refrigeration, the electrical grid, the internet). Others will have 1-2 (anesthesia, shipping containers). The structure flexes — same grammar, different number of iterations.

**The test:** If you can identify distinct phases where the technology entered a new domain (commercial → industrial → consumer, or one industry → another → households), it's multi-wave. If there's a relatively clean before/after with one main diffusion story, it's single-arc.

## OPENING: The Hook
*Target: 12-18 min | Both hosts, conversational*

Open with a story that grabs. Ground the listener in what came before. Then preview the journey ahead.

### Cold Open
Start with a single vivid story or moment — something unexpected, human, and specific that makes the listener lean in before they know what the episode is about. This isn't a stat or a thesis statement. It's a scene.

**What makes a good cold open:**
- A named person doing something surprising (a 23-year-old loading ice onto a ship bound for the Caribbean; a doctor in rural Florida building a machine everyone says is impossible)
- A moment of crisis, absurdity, or drama that embodies the episode's themes
- Something the listener has never heard before — the "wait, what?" factor
- Short: 2-3 minutes max. Set the hook, then pull back to the bigger picture.

**Tone:** Narrative. You're telling a story, not introducing a topic. The listener should be curious before they even know the subject of the episode.

### By the Numbers
Lead with 3-5 stats that capture current scale and importance. These should make someone say "wait, really?"

**What to research:**
- Current adoption/usage numbers (global, US, etc.)
- Economic scale (market size, cost, spending)
- Physical scale where relevant (miles of cable, tons produced, etc.)

**Make it tangible:**
- Compare to things people understand ("enough to circle the earth X times")
- Use per-person or per-household framing when helpful
- Historical comparisons ("in 1950 this was X, today it's Y")

### The World Before
The true baseline — what life looked like before ANY version of this technology existed. This is the emotional anchor for the entire episode. Everything that follows is the journey from here to now.

**What to research:**
- What did people actually do? (the dominant workaround — curing food, hand-copying texts, riding horses)
- What did it cost in money, time, or effort?
- Who was excluded or harmed by the absence?
- Contemporary accounts that make it visceral

**Tone:** Vivid, immersive, brief. The listener should feel the weight of the "before." We'll return to this at the end to show the full distance traveled.

### The Road Ahead
Preview the waves. Give listeners a roadmap of the journey — name the eras, sketch the arc, build anticipation. The listener should know they're about to travel through distinct chapters and be curious about each one.

**What to include:**
- A one-sentence characterization of each wave (era name + what makes it interesting)
- The overall shape of the story: "This isn't a single invention that changed the world overnight. It happened in waves, and each one built on — and destroyed — what came before."
- A tease of the most surprising or counterintuitive element coming up

**Why this matters:** Long episodes (90-120 min) need a roadmap. Listeners stay engaged when they know where they are in the larger story. This also sets up the wave structure as a deliberate narrative choice, not just chronological plodding.

## THE WAVES

Each wave follows the same pattern: a breakthrough or evolution, the messy process of spreading, and the consequences that reshape the world and set up the next wave. Think of these as chapters in an evolving story, not repetitive cycles — each one should feel distinct in tone and stakes.

---

### Wave [N]: [Title]
*Target: 15-25 min per wave | One host drives, other participates*

#### The Breakthrough

What's the new discovery, invention, or critical evolution in this wave? This is the human story — messy, contingent, often dramatic.

**What to look for:**
- 2-3 key people with vivid human details (resist the lone genius narrative)
- The pivotal moment, insight, or accident
- Failed attempts and near-misses that show it wasn't inevitable
- Rivals, collaborators, people history forgot

**Look for:**
- Unexpected backgrounds or motivations
- Personal stakes and drama
- The "almost" moments — who got close and why did they fail?

#### Anchor Stories

Every wave needs 1-2 specific, vivid, short-form stories that serve as microcosms of the larger dynamics at play. These are the moments that make great audio — not summaries of what happened, but scenes the listener can picture. A disaster, a courtroom battle, a family's experience, a specific day something went terribly wrong or unexpectedly right.

**What makes a good anchor story:**
- **Specific**: A named person, a date, a place. "In May 1929, at the Cleveland Clinic..." not "there were safety incidents."
- **Vivid**: The listener can picture the scene. Sensory details, human reactions, stakes that are immediately clear.
- **Emblematic**: It captures the larger dynamic in miniature. The swill milk scandal isn't just a tragedy — it's the entire case for why refrigeration mattered, compressed into one horrifying story.
- **Short**: 2-3 minutes to tell, not a 10-minute digression. These are punctuation marks in the narrative, not chapters of their own.

**Where they go:** Anchor stories can live in any section of a wave — as the entry point to a Breakthrough, as evidence in Diffusion & Resistance, or as the emotional punch in What Changed. Place them where they'll land hardest.

**Research note:** These are often the hardest things to find and the most valuable. Look for them in magazine features, book chapters, newspaper archives, and documentary sources. A single great anchor story is worth more than five paragraphs of summary.

#### How It Works

*Include this section in whichever wave first introduces the core mechanism.* For refrigeration, that's when mechanical refrigeration arrives. For the internet, it's when packet switching is developed. For the electrical grid, it's when generators and transmission are first demonstrated.

**What to research:**
- The core mechanism or principle (simplified)
- What new capability this unlocked
- Why previous approaches couldn't achieve this
- A simple analogy that makes it click

**Tone:** Mental model, not engineering diagram. Think "what does this let you do that you couldn't before?" not "here are the components." A good analogy is worth more than a technical explanation. Keep this to 5 minutes max.

**In later waves:** You don't re-explain the core mechanism. You only explain what's *new* — a safer refrigerant, a miniaturized version, a new application. One or two sentences, not a full section.

#### Diffusion & Resistance

How did this wave spread? Who adopted first, who fought it, and what had to be true for it to take off? This is often where the real story is — the messy middle that most accounts skip.

**What to look for:**
- **Early adopters**: Who adopted first and why? What was their incentive?
- **Resisters**: Who fought it and why? What were their arguments? (Often more reasonable than we remember.)
- **Enabling conditions**: What complementary technologies, infrastructure, economic conditions, or policy changes had to exist?
- **The tipping point**: Was there a specific moment it became inevitable? A price threshold, a killer app, a cultural shift, a crisis?
- **Key companies or institutions**: Who commercialized it? Business model innovations? (Not an Acquired-style deep dive, but companies are part of the diffusion story.)

**The question to answer:** Why did this wave happen *when* it did — not earlier, not later?

#### What Changed

What did this wave make possible? What did it destroy or displace? And critically: how did it set up the next wave?

**What to look for:**
- Immediate, visible consequences (what a contemporary observer would have noticed)
- Winners and losers — specific people, companies, industries, regions
- The transition: what was now possible but not yet realized? What gap remained?

**The bridge:** End each wave by showing what was now possible but not yet real — the tension that the next wave will resolve. The ice trade made people expect cold, but it was seasonal and fragile. Mechanical refrigeration transformed industry, but homes still had iceboxes. This is the narrative engine that pulls the listener into the next chapter.

### Wave Guidance

**Multi-wave episodes** (most infrastructure/physical technologies):
- Typically 3-4 waves
- Each wave: 15-25 minutes
- Total waves section: 50-75 minutes

**Single-arc episodes** (some digital technologies, compressed timelines):
- 1-2 waves (essentially the original three-act structure, just using this vocabulary)
- Each wave: 25-35 minutes

**Pacing:** Not every wave needs equal weight. The wave with the richest human drama or the most surprising diffusion story should get more time. Others can be tighter. Let the material dictate.

## BUILT IN: The Big Picture
*Target: 15-20 min | Both hosts, conversational*

After the waves, zoom out. The listener has been immersed in the individual chapters — now give them the full view of the transformation and what it means.

### The Full Arc
Connect the "World Before" to now. What's the total distance traveled?

**What to look for:**
- The most striking before/after comparison, now that the listener has context
- Numbers revisited — bookend with the hook stats
- Structural changes that span multiple waves: labor, geography, culture, inequality, regulation
- Consequences nobody predicted

**Tone:** This is the "holy crap" moment where you step back and see the full picture. The individual waves each felt incremental; the total transformation is staggering.

### The Backbone Test
*The show's signature closing framework. Apply to every episode.*

Five questions that examine how deeply this technology is embedded in modern life — and where it's headed:

**1. Invisible?**
Has this become invisible infrastructure — something you only notice when it fails? When did it cross from "remarkable" to "assumed"? What does it feel like when it breaks?

**2. What depends on it?**
What systems, industries, behaviors, or ways of life now exist ONLY because this technology exists? Map the dependency chain. (Supermarkets depend on refrigeration. Suburbs depend on supermarkets. American political geography depends on suburbs.)

**3. What's the hidden cost?**
What are we still paying that most people don't see? Energy, labor conditions, environmental impact, inequality, fragility. Every backbone technology has a ledger with entries most people never read.

**4. Could we go back?**
What would collapse if this disappeared tomorrow? How deep is the dependency? This question reveals just how load-bearing the technology has become — and how much we take for granted.

**5. What's next?**
Backbone technologies don't stop evolving once they become invisible — they keep developing behind the scenes. What's happened recently? What's coming down the line? What would the next wave look like? For refrigeration: solid-state cooling, closing the developing-world cold chain gap, next-generation refrigerants. For power: smart grids, distributed generation, wireless power. This is the forward-looking question — a reminder that "from breakthrough to built-in" isn't the end of the story.

**Note:** You don't have to treat these as a literal checklist every episode. They're a lens for the closing conversation. Some episodes will lean harder on certain questions. The point is to give listeners a consistent framework for thinking about infrastructure — the way Acquired uses seven powers for business strategy.

### Open Questions
2-3 genuinely unresolved questions. These should feel like the start of a conversation the listener will continue in their own head.

**What to research:**
- Ongoing debates among experts
- Tradeoffs we still haven't figured out
- Tensions between this technology's benefits and its costs
- The frontier — what's coming next in this space

**Tone:** Curious, not preachy. We're raising questions, not answering them.

## HOST DIVISION

### Principle: Alternate by Wave

Each wave has a **driver** — one host who leads the narrative, sets the scene, introduces the characters, and carries the thread. The other host participates: asks questions, reacts, pushes back, adds color. Hosts alternate waves throughout the episode.

**Why by wave (not by segment type):**
- Each host gets complete mini-narratives to own and drive
- Natural variety in voices keeps energy high across 90-120 minutes
- Neither host monologues for too long
- Both hosts engage with all aspects of the story (discovery, diffusion, aftermath) rather than being typecast

**Opening & Built In:** Both hosts, conversational. These are discussion sections — back and forth, riffing, reacting — not narrated sections.

**Suggested assignment approach:** During prep, each host claims the waves that excite them most. If both want the same wave, the one who did less research on it gets it (fresh reactions are good radio). If a wave has a natural fit — one host knows the industry, the other knows the science — lean into that.

## Things to Avoid

- **Don't over-explain "how it works."** One clear analogy beats five technical paragraphs. 5 minutes max.
- **Don't treat adoption as inevitable.** Resistance and contingency are often the story. Give the resisters their due.
- **Don't let waves blur together.** Each should feel like a distinct chapter with its own characters and stakes. Clear transitions matter.
- **Don't front-load all the characters.** Spread the human drama across waves. Each wave should introduce fresh faces.
- **Don't save all consequences for the end.** Each wave has its own "what changed." The Big Picture is for the full-arc view, not a dump of everything.
- **Don't use today's values to judge past decisions.** Give historical actors their context.
- **Don't "enter the dorm room."** Avoid simplistic good/bad framing. We're exploring, not moralizing.
- **Don't worship founders.** The people matter, but so do teams, institutions, timing, and luck.
