## Evaluation Criteria

When considering a topic, ask:

1. **Is the "before" vivid?** Can listeners feel what life was like without this?
2. **Is there human drama?** Inventors, resisters, winners, losers?
3. **Is the diffusion story interesting?** Why was adoption slow/fast? Who blocked it?
4. **Are societal impacts clear?** Labor, geography, culture, regulation?
5. **Is it under-covered?** Has this been done to death elsewhere?
6. **Are sources accessible?** Books, papers, journalism we can draw from?
7. **Are we both excited?** If research feels like a chore, pick something else.
