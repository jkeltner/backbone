# Backbone: From Breakthrough to Built-In

## Concept

A podcast exploring the technological innovations that quietly shape modern life—how they were discovered, how they spread (and who resisted), and the ripple effects that followed.

**Core Differentiator:** While shows like Acquired focus on companies and deals, Backbone focuses on *innovations themselves*—industry-wide shifts that changed how the world works, regardless of which company "won."

**The Unique Angle:** Most tech podcasts skip from "invention" to "winner." Backbone emphasizes the messy middle—the *diffusion*: resistance, timing, complementary technologies, and the moment something crossed from novelty to inevitability.

## Format

**Hosts:** Jeff Keltner and Cyrus Mistry

**Episode Length:** 90-120 minutes

**Release Cadence:** Monthly (initially)

**Style:**
- Deeply researched, narrative-driven
- Semi-scripted: structured outline with room for genuine discussion
- One host "drives" each section, but both participate throughout
- Focus on human drama—both in discovery and in societal impact
- Accessible explanations (mental models, not engineering diagrams)

## Audience

People curious about how the modern world actually works—the hidden systems and innovations we take for granted. Likely overlaps with Acquired listeners, history/science podcast fans, and anyone who's ever wondered "wait, how did that become a thing?"

---

## Goals

**Primary:** Make something we're proud of and enjoy creating.

**Secondary:** Build an audience of curious people who want to understand the world better.

**Not a goal (for now):** Monetization. This is a passion project first.

## Podcast Description

Every technology you rely on today was once unimaginable. You flip a switch and the lights come on. You turn a tap and clean water flows. But how did any of this become normal? Backbone traces the innovations that built modern life — from the messy human stories behind their discovery, through the resistance and lucky breaks that shaped how they spread, to the consequences nobody saw coming. Hosted by Jeff Keltner and Cyrus Mistry.
