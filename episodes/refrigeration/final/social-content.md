## Pull Quotes

**1.**
"We have built a world that physically cannot function at ambient temperature. Seven billion people fed through the cold chain. Hundreds of millions living in climates that would be lethal without air conditioning. The dependency is total. And it's irreversible."
-- Jeff Keltner

**2.**
"A man who invented leaded gasoline and Freon... both environmental catastrophes... dies killed by a third invention. Before learning what any of them did."
-- Cyrus Mistry

**3.**
"Orphaned at nine. Self-taught. Sixty-one patents. Father of refrigerated transportation. And most people have never heard his name."
-- Cyrus Mistry, on Frederick McKinley Jones

## Thread-Style Summary

**Post 1:**
In 1806, a 23-year-old Bostonian loaded 130 tons of frozen pond water onto a ship and sailed for the Caribbean. No captain would carry the cargo. The Boston Gazette called it a "slippery speculation." He went to debtor's prison. Twice. He died worth $200 million.

**Post 2:**
Frederic Tudor, "The Ice King," didn't invent anything. He created a market for cold where none existed. His secret: give ice away free to bartenders and wait. "A man who has drank his drinks cold can never be presented with them warm again." He understood addiction economics in 1815.

**Post 3:**
By the 1880s, the ice industry employed 90,000 workers and 25,000 horses. American ships carried more ice than any cargo except cotton. Then came the warm winter of 1890. No ice formed. New York panicked. An entire empire built on weather couldn't survive the weather.

**Post 4:**
A Florida doctor named John Gorrie invented the ice machine in 1844. The northern ice industry destroyed him. "There is a crank down in Apalachicola, Florida, that thinks he can make ice as good as God Almighty." He died broke at 51. His invention now powers every fridge and AC on Earth.

**Post 5:**
In 1930, a chemist inhaled a lungful of a mysterious gas and blew out a candle. Thomas Midgley proved Freon was safe. 8 million refrigerators sold in 5 years. 44 years later, scientists discovered his "safe" compound was eating the ozone layer. He'd been dead for 30 years by then.

**Post 6:**
Frederick McKinley Jones: orphaned at 9, left school at 11, self-taught engineer. Invented truck-mounted refrigeration from library books and a $6 bet. 61 patents. First Black member of the refrigeration engineering society. First Black American to receive the National Medal of Technology. Most people have never heard his name.

**Post 7:**
Today, 70% of all food passes through the cold chain. Refrigeration uses 25% of global electricity. And the cooling paradox: we need more cold because the planet is warming, but cooling accelerates warming. We built a world that cannot function at ambient temperature. And the bill is coming due. New episode of Backbone is out now.

## Short Description

From frozen pond water to the ozone layer: how humanity built a civilization that cannot survive without artificial cold, and the hidden cost of the technology that feeds seven billion people. New episode of Backbone: From Breakthrough to Built-In.
