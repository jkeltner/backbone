# Episode Metadata

**Episode Title:** Refrigeration: A World That Cannot Function at Ambient Temperature

**Episode Description:** In 1806, a twenty-three-year-old loads a ship with frozen pond water and sails for the Caribbean. Everyone calls him a fool. Two centuries later, seventy percent of everything you eat depends on a cold chain you've never seen, powered by a quarter of the world's electricity -- and the chemical that made it all possible tore a hole in the sky before anyone noticed.

**Episode Number:** [To be assigned]

**Estimated Runtime:** Approximately 87 minutes (13,108 words at 150 words per minute). This falls slightly below the 90-minute target but within acceptable range; natural pauses, audio tags, and conversational pacing will extend the spoken runtime closer to 90 minutes.
