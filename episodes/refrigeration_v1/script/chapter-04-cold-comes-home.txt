--- SEGMENT BREAK: Wave 3 - Cold Comes Home ---

JEFF: Alright. End of the last wave, Cyrus left us with a problem. Mechanical refrigeration has conquered the factory, the brewery, the railroad car. But homes? The chemicals running through those machines can kill you in your sleep. Families are keeping their refrigerators in the backyard. Einstein is so haunted by a dead family in Berlin that he's designing his own fridge. The world needs a breakthrough. And the man who delivers it is... well, let's just say history has complicated feelings about him.

CYRUS: That's one way to put it.

JEFF: His name is Thomas Midgley Junior. Born eighteen eighty-nine, Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. Mechanical engineer, trained at Cornell. Working for General Motors and Frigidaire. And by nineteen twenty-eight, he's already infamous in certain circles because he's the guy who invented tetraethyl lead... leaded gasoline.

CYRUS: So he's already responsible for one environmental catastrophe.

JEFF: Already responsible for one. He actually gave himself lead poisoning while working on leaded gasoline. But GM doesn't care about that. They've got a bigger problem. Their Frigidaire division is trying to sell home refrigerators, and people keep dying from the refrigerant fumes. So in nineteen twenty-eight, they hand Midgley a challenge... find us a refrigerant that won't kill our customers.

CYRUS: Seems like a reasonable ask.

JEFF: Reasonable ask. And Midgley, along with a collaborator named Albert Henne, attacks it systematically. They literally search the periodic table, element by element, looking for compounds that are simultaneously non-toxic, non-flammable, stable, and effective as a refrigerant. In three days... three DAYS... they identify dichlorodifluoromethane. A chlorofluorocarbon. They call it Freon.

CYRUS: Three days to find the chemical that changes everything.

JEFF: Three days. And then comes the demonstration. April, nineteen thirty. American Chemical Society meeting, Atlanta, Georgia. Thomas Midgley Junior takes the stage. He's carrying a small vial of this new compound and a candle. He lights the candle. The audience is watching. Then Midgley does something that nobody in that room will ever forget.

CYRUS: What does he do?

JEFF: He pours the Freon into a bowl. He heats it to a boil with a burner. And then... he deeply inhales a lungful of the vapor.

CYRUS: He BREATHES it?

JEFF: He breathes it. The entire audience is watching. If this chemical is toxic... Midgley is about to collapse on stage. But he doesn't. He stands there perfectly fine. And then he gently exhales the vapor... toward the candle flame.

CYRUS: [pause]

JEFF: The flame goes out.

CYRUS: [pause] So in one gesture, he proves it's both non-toxic AND non-flammable.

JEFF: In one theatrical gesture. He just breathed it, so it can't be toxic. It just extinguished a flame, so it can't be flammable. No one in that room can argue that Freon is dangerous.

CYRUS: As a piece of scientific salesmanship, you can't beat it. One breath, one candle, argument over.

JEFF: It's maybe the most consequential chemistry demonstration in history. GM and DuPont immediately make Midgley vice president of Kinetic Chemicals, their joint venture to manufacture Freon. Within five years... within FIVE YEARS... manufacturers using Freon sell more than eight million refrigerators nationally, blowing the competition out of the market. The safety crisis is over. The adoption explosion begins.

CYRUS: And nobody suspects...

JEFF: Nobody suspects a thing. But we'll come back to that.

--- SEGMENT BREAK: Wave 3 - The Adoption Explosion ---

JEFF: So, Freon removes the safety barrier. But getting a refrigerator into every American kitchen... that requires something else. It requires making it affordable. And this is where the story takes a turn that I find genuinely counterintuitive.

CYRUS: The Depression paradox.

JEFF: The Depression paradox. Remember that number from the top of the show... eight percent of American homes with a fridge in nineteen thirty? The GE Monitor Top, which is the first really successful home model, costs about five hundred and twenty-five dollars. That is a fortune for a working family.

CYRUS: That's like eight or nine thousand in today's money.

JEFF: Way out of reach for most people. But GE does something clever. They partner with local utility companies. And the utility companies offer installment plans... ten dollars a month, added to your electric bill. The utilities WANT people to buy refrigerators, because refrigerators consume electricity. More fridges, more revenue.

CYRUS: So the utility company is essentially financing the adoption of its own best customer.

JEFF: Exactly. And then the Depression hits. And you'd think... okay, economic catastrophe, nobody's buying appliances. But the opposite happens. Manufacturers slash prices. The five hundred and twenty-five dollar Monitor Top drops to around two hundred dollars by the mid-thirties. By nineteen forty, basic models cost a hundred and fifty-two dollars. And struggling families discover something remarkable...

CYRUS: The refrigerator saves money.

JEFF: The refrigerator saves money. If you can't afford to throw away spoiled food, you can afford to buy a fridge that prevents spoilage. A family that's watching every penny discovers that preserving food cuts their grocery bill. The economics of cold become MORE compelling during hard times, not less.

CYRUS: So the worst economic crisis in American history actually ACCELERATES refrigerator adoption.

JEFF: It accelerates it. Eight percent in nineteen thirty. Fifty-six percent by nineteen forty. Eighty-five percent by nineteen forty-four. In roughly fifteen years, the refrigerator goes from a luxury item to near-universal. Faster than smartphones. Faster than almost anything.

CYRUS: And the iceman?

JEFF: The iceman starts to vanish. Not overnight... ice delivery persists into the nineteen forties in many cities, partly out of habit, partly out of loyalty to the iceman who'd been coming to your house every day for years. But by the nineteen fifties, it's over. Ninety percent of city homes have a mechanical refrigerator. The profession that had defined daily American domestic life for generations just... disappears.

CYRUS: An entire profession. Gone.

JEFF: Gone.

--- SEGMENT BREAK: Wave 3 - Anchor Story: The Cold-Storage Banquet ---

JEFF: But here's the thing, Cyrus. Even after Freon makes refrigerators safe, even as prices drop and adoption explodes... a lot of people STILL don't trust cold-stored food. And this fear goes back decades. Let me take you to Chicago, October twenty-third, nineteen eleven.

CYRUS: Nineteen eleven? That's twenty years before Freon.

JEFF: Twenty years before Freon. But the anxiety about refrigerated food is already intense. Upton Sinclair's The Jungle has come out five years earlier, in nineteen oh six, and it has absolutely SHATTERED public trust in the food industry. People are terrified of what's being done to their food behind closed doors. And cold storage... the idea that you could put food in a warehouse for months and then sell it as fresh... that feels like just another way to disguise old or spoiled food.

CYRUS: So what happens in Chicago?

JEFF: The National Poultry, Butter, and Egg Association decides to fight back. And their strategy is... [pause] a banquet. A formal banquet where every item on the menu has been cold-stored. Some of it for months.

CYRUS: A publicity stunt.

JEFF: A MASSIVE publicity stunt. October twenty-third, nineteen eleven. The Louis the Sixteenth room of the Hotel Sherman in Chicago. Four hundred guests, including the mayor and the city's health commissioner, sit down to one of the most unusual meals of the twentieth century.

CYRUS: What are they eating?

JEFF: Everything but the olives in the dry martinis has been refrigerated. The eggs in the egg salad? Cold-stored. The apples in the apple pie? Cold-stored. The chicken? Killed months earlier and kept on ice the entire time. And the secretary of the association stands up and addresses the guests and praises their... and this is a direct quote... "considerable courage in the face of all that has been written in the newspapers."

CYRUS: "Considerable courage." To eat dinner.

JEFF: To eat dinner! Think about that. In nineteen eleven, eating cold-stored food requires COURAGE. And there's a reason. Before artificial lights in chicken coops, fresh eggs were only really available in spring. If you wanted an egg in October, when this banquet is being held, that was rare. Cold storage made year-round eggs possible. But the idea of eating a months-old egg was genuinely unsettling.

CYRUS: So did anyone get sick?

JEFF: Nobody gets sick. The banquet is declared a success. But the press is NOT won over. The Chicago Inter Ocean runs a scathing editorial the next day. And one newspaper offers what I think is the most devastating observation... "The one silver lining is that soon everyone who can remember what food is supposed to taste like, pre-refrigeration, will be dead."

CYRUS: [laughs] That is brutal.

JEFF: Brutal but kind of true. And that resistance... that lingering suspicion about cold-stored food... persists for DECADES. Even into the nineteen thirties and forties, as Freon makes refrigerators safe and adoption explodes, many households keep getting ice delivered. Partly habit, partly loyalty to their iceman, and partly a lingering distrust that cold equals fresh. It's a trust problem more than a technology problem.

CYRUS: And you could argue we STILL haven't fully resolved it. "Fresh, never frozen" is still a marketing premium today.

JEFF: Even though flash-frozen food is often scientifically fresher than something that's been sitting in a refrigerator for five days. But we'll come back to that.

--- SEGMENT BREAK: Wave 3 - Anchor Story: Frederick McKinley Jones ---

JEFF: Okay. So by the late nineteen thirties, refrigeration is in the kitchen. The adoption explosion is in full swing. But there's a critical gap. How do you keep food cold in transit? Trucks carry perishables packed in ice and salt, and the ice melts. Long-distance shipments of meat, produce, dairy... they routinely spoil. The "last mile" of the cold chain... from processing plant to grocery store... is broken. And the person who fixes it... Cyrus, this is one of my favorite stories in all the research we've done.

CYRUS: Frederick McKinley Jones.

JEFF: Frederick McKinley Jones. Born May seventeenth, eighteen ninety-three, in Covington, Kentucky. His father is an Irish railroad worker named John Jones. His mother is African American, and she leaves when Frederick is very young. His father struggles to raise him alone and eventually sends him to be raised by a Catholic priest, Father Ryan, at a rectory in Cincinnati around age seven.

CYRUS: So he's basically growing up in a church rectory.

JEFF: In a church rectory. And then when Frederick is nine years old... his father dies. He's an orphan. He leaves school after sixth grade, at age eleven. Eleven years old, on his own.

CYRUS: [pause] Eleven.

JEFF: Eleven. He gets a job as a cleaning boy at a garage in Cincinnati. R.C. Crothers Garage. And this is where the story starts to become something special. Because Frederick Jones is one of those people who just... absorbs knowledge. He watches the mechanics. He studies how things work. He's promoted to mechanic's helper. By age fourteen, he's the shop foreman.

CYRUS: Shop foreman at fourteen. With a sixth-grade education.

JEFF: By nineteen, he's one of the most well-known auto racers in the Great Lakes region. In nineteen twelve, he moves to Hallock, Minnesota... a tiny town near the Canadian border... and works as a mechanic and farmer's hand. When World War One breaks out, he serves as a sergeant in France, where he rewires his entire camp for electricity, telephone, and telegraph service. After the war, he goes back to Hallock, teaches himself electronics, and builds a radio transmitter for the town.

CYRUS: He left school at eleven. He taught HIMSELF electronics.

JEFF: Taught himself. And he supports himself by driving physicians on winter house calls in rural Minnesota. And because the roads are terrible, he invents a motorized snow machine using airplane parts.

CYRUS: This guy is just... constantly inventing things.

JEFF: Constantly inventing. Around nineteen twenty-seven, a businessman named Joseph Numero is looking for an engineer at his company, Ultraphone Sound Systems, in Minneapolis. Jones shows up. And the receptionist tells him... "We don't have any jobs for a colored boy."

CYRUS: [pause]

JEFF: Numero hires him anyway. And Jones proceeds to convert silent-movie projectors into talking projectors using scrap materials. He becomes Numero's indispensable engineer. And then, in nineteen thirty-eight, the moment that changes everything. Numero is on a golf course with a friend in the trucking industry. The friend complains about a recent disaster... a shipment of chickens from St. Paul to Chicago spoiled because the ice and salt couldn't last the trip. Total loss.

CYRUS: And Numero says...

JEFF: Numero bets him six dollars that he has an engineer who can solve the problem in thirty days. Six dollars. They shake hands.

CYRUS: [laughs] Six dollars.

JEFF: Numero goes back to the shop and tells Jones about the bet. And in classic Fred Jones fashion... the man who left school at eleven, who taught himself mechanics, electronics, radio engineering, and cinema sound technology... goes to the library and teaches himself everything about refrigeration. In a matter of weeks, he designs the Thermo Control Model A. A portable, automatic, truck-mounted refrigeration unit.

CYRUS: From a library. In a matter of weeks.

JEFF: From a library. But the Model A is just the beginning. Previous attempts at truck refrigeration had all failed for the same reason... road vibrations broke the equipment. And this is where Jones's background in cinema sound equipment pays off. Sound equipment for movie theaters had the same problem... it had to handle vibration without failing. Jones knows how to build for shock. He refines the design, and the Model C, completed in nineteen forty-one, becomes the industry standard. Compact. Lightweight. And crucially... shockproof.

CYRUS: So all of his previous experience... the garage, the racing, the cinema equipment... it all converges in this one invention.

JEFF: It all converges. Jones and Numero co-found the U.S. Thermo Control Company in nineteen thirty-eight, later renamed Thermo King. Jones is vice president. The patent is granted July twelfth, nineteen forty.

CYRUS: And then the war comes.

JEFF: And then the war comes. And Jones's refrigeration units find a use nobody anticipated. The military puts them to work preserving blood plasma, medicine, and food for troops in the field. A six-dollar bet on spoiled chickens ends up helping save soldiers' lives.

CYRUS: You can't make this stuff up.

JEFF: After the war, Jones keeps inventing. Sixty-one patents over his lifetime, forty of them for refrigeration. He also invents portable X-ray machines and personal radio units. In nineteen forty-four, he becomes the first African American elected to the American Society of Refrigeration Engineers.

CYRUS: In nineteen forty-four. During segregation.

JEFF: During segregation. The man whose job application was met with "We don't have any jobs for a colored boy" becomes the first Black member of the industry's professional society.

CYRUS: [pause] And what happens to him?

JEFF: Frederick McKinley Jones dies on February twenty-first, nineteen sixty-one. He's sixty-seven years old. In nineteen ninety-one, thirty years after his death, Jones is posthumously awarded the National Medal of Technology... the first Black American to receive the honor. President George H.W. Bush presents the award to Jones's and Numero's widows at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden.

CYRUS: [pause] Orphaned at nine. Self-taught. Sixty-one patents. Father of refrigerated transportation. And most people have never heard his name.

JEFF: Most people have never heard his name. Today, Thermo King, now owned by Trane Technologies, is a global leader in transport refrigeration. Jones's invention... the automatic truck-mounted refrigeration unit... made the modern food supply chain possible. Without him, cold stays in kitchens and warehouses. With him... cold moves. The last mile is complete.

CYRUS: And that completes the cold chain. Farm to processing plant to truck to store to kitchen. Every link in place.

--- SEGMENT BREAK: Wave 3 - The Hidden Cost ---

JEFF: So by the nineteen fifties, the picture is complete. The refrigerator is in every kitchen. Birdseye's frozen food fills the aisles... a guy who watched Inuit fishermen flash-freeze fish in Labrador and turned indigenous knowledge into a multi-billion dollar industry. The supermarket is the new cathedral of abundance. The cold chain stretches from farm to table. And infant mortality has plummeted... thanks to pasteurization AND refrigeration working together to make milk safe.

CYRUS: And the "safe" chemical that made all of this possible...

JEFF: Is silently accumulating in the stratosphere. Thomas Midgley's Freon... the compound he breathed in and blew out a candle with, the compound that sold eight million refrigerators, the compound that freed families from the terror of toxic fumes... is molecule by molecule eating the ozone layer that protects all life on Earth.

CYRUS: When do people figure this out?

JEFF: Not until nineteen seventy-four. Forty-four years after Midgley's demonstration. Scientists Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina predict that CFCs are destroying the ozone. In nineteen eighty-five, the ozone hole over Antarctica is confirmed. Nineteen eighty-seven, the Montreal Protocol is signed, phasing out CFCs.

CYRUS: And Midgley never knew.

JEFF: Never knew. Because Thomas Midgley died in nineteen forty-four, thirty years before anyone discovered what his invention was doing. And the way he died... it's almost too much. In nineteen forty, he contracts polio, which leaves him severely disabled. He invents an elaborate rope-and-pulley system to help lift himself out of bed. On November second, nineteen forty-four, at age fifty-five, he becomes entangled in the ropes and strangles to death. Killed by his own invention.

CYRUS: A man who invented leaded gasoline and Freon... both environmental catastrophes... dies killed by a third invention. Before learning what any of them did.

JEFF: A historian named J.R. McNeill will later call Midgley "the most environmentally destructive person who ever lived"... a man who had "more impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history."

CYRUS: [pause] And the kicker is... he was trying to HELP. The leaded gasoline was supposed to stop engine knock. The Freon was supposed to stop families from being poisoned. He solved real problems. He saved real lives. The consequences just took decades to arrive.

JEFF: That's the thing about this whole story, isn't it? Every solution creates a new problem. Tudor creates the demand for cold, but builds on a foundation that can melt. Gorrie invents the machine, and the industry destroys him. Swift ships dressed beef, and creates the conditions Sinclair exposes in The Jungle. Midgley makes refrigerators safe, and tears a hole in the sky. The pattern never breaks.

CYRUS: And now we're living with all of it. The good AND the consequences. Which brings us to the big question... what has cold become?

JEFF: It's become invisible. It's become the backbone. And it's time to find out what that really means.
