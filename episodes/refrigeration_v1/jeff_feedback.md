## Research

### Overview

* Why include books? It doesn't seem like you'll be able to access them as an automated tool so why are we including them in the must-read section? 
* Do we think it's worth identifying, in general for all episodes, that we use some authoritative sources that should definitely be checked in addition to whatever Google or web searches come up? I'm just curious if you think that's useful or if it's going to be overly restrictive in terms of getting to the best research 
* Is the overview too focused on personal characters and details that will come up better in the detailed individual wave research areas? Just curious if we should simplify a little bit or remove some of the details of the wave type in the overview version of the research.
* Love the complementary technologies required section. Wonder if we should make that a part of the overall flow and process for these kinds of podcasts. Seems like a really cool addition

## BluePrint

* When we first outlined this episode, there were four different waves. This time there are three. I'd love to just think about why that is and which one I think is the right answer to see if the prompts we have now are working better or worse than the original time we did this when it was intended to be a human-to-human podcast, not fully automated 
* One thing I thought would be really fun in the intro was talking about the "before" being things like salted meats (maybe focusing on things like bacon that people love) that really can't come about because of the lack of refrigeration. I don't know that it's the anchor of the hook but I think it's an interesting tidbit that kind of can add a little flavor to that. I don't know how we work them in the instructions but it seems like an example of something I think would be good to do in the intros.
* Maybe this is in the script and the research for the wave but in Wave 1 I do wonder about leaning into a little bit the concept of the urbanization being enabled by the growth of cities being enabled by coal. You could feed more people than would be able to be fed by the farms within a one-day journey.



## Scripts

### Chapter 1 - Opening

* I feel like we need a little something before this story. The story is good but I feel like we need some sort of an intro hook to listen to this. What's going to be interesting? Kind of the phases, something that's an interesting banter that we can then play music after and then get into the stories. Maybe the opening of the first thing. I think it's a really good story but I feel like there's something I used to go before that 

### Chapter 5 - Built-In

* Should we have some sort of a standard closing context line? I know that the Freakonomics guy has "until next time, take care of yourself and if you can, somebody else too." Some little closing line but I think we ought to do something closing.

  I think we need to add someone there like "subscribe". I don't know that we needed advertising yet but that kind of reminders to follow the podcast where you can see and share with your friends, that kind of thing ought to be built into the script somewhere 

## Final

### Metadata

* Don't love the title. Should be a little catchier. The one-word title is great. The subtitle is not ideal 

* Episode description is quite good 

* Is the episode summary too long, that the key topics covered? There's a lot of stuff in there. I'm just not sure if the show notes are going to be a little. The summary is great. The show notes seem like they're quite long. I don't know if we need to include all that 

* Let's just put in the parking lot that we really want to review the social media strategy around this. The social content is pretty good but I think we have to figure out an ongoing approach to automate some sort of posting about these episodes and engagement with context or responses from the audience. Just put that in the parking lot for now.

  I think first we need to get the content right. That's something to keep in mind before we launch this thing 

## General

* Would it be useful to generate some personality files for the two hosts that we've got, a little sense of what they focus on and what kind of interjections they might make? Something to make it a little more personal and individual versus some more generic host personality? I ask this because I think a lot of these podcasts really work because of the rapport and the interaction between the two hosts. I want to make sure we find a way to define those host personalities and ensure they have the right kind of interaction to make this engaging content 
* How hard would it be to create a script to actually do the generation of the audio given the length of the text files and the two hosts? We need some sort of a way to do the back and forth with V3 of a lot of labs. Can you research for me how hard it would be to actually have a script that can take a final script and produce the audio file?
