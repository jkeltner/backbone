# Episodes Folder

This folder contains individual episode research and materials.

## Structure

For each episode, create a subfolder:

```
/episodes/
  /refrigeration/
    outline.md         ← copy of episode_template.md, filled in
    research_notes.md  ← AI research outputs, organized by section
    sources.md         ← books, articles, papers to consult
    fact_check.md      ← claims to verify before recording
    script.md          ← final script/outline for recording (optional)
```

## Getting Started

1. Copy `episode_template.md` into your new episode folder as `outline.md`
2. Create `research_notes.md` and start capturing AI research outputs
3. Use `ai_research_guide.md` for prompting strategies
