# Podcast Overview

## Concept

A podcast exploring the technological innovations that quietly shape modern life—how they were discovered, how they spread (and who resisted), and the ripple effects that followed.

**Core Differentiator:** While shows like Acquired focus on companies and deals, this show focuses on *innovations themselves*—industry-wide shifts that changed how the world works, regardless of which company "won."

**The Unique Angle:** Most tech podcasts skip from "invention" to "winner." This show emphasizes the messy middle—the *diffusion*: resistance, timing, complementary technologies, and the moment something crossed from novelty to inevitability.

## Format

**Hosts:** Jeff and Cyrus

**Episode Length:** 90-120 minutes

**Release Cadence:** Monthly (initially)

**Style:**
- Deeply researched, narrative-driven
- Semi-scripted: structured outline with room for genuine discussion
- One host "drives" each section, but both participate throughout
- Focus on human drama—both in discovery and in societal impact
- Accessible explanations (mental models, not engineering diagrams)

## Audience

People curious about how the modern world actually works—the hidden systems and innovations we take for granted. Likely overlaps with Acquired listeners, history/science podcast fans, and anyone who's ever wondered "wait, how did that become a thing?"

---

## Goals

**Primary:** Make something we're proud of and enjoy creating.

**Secondary:** Build an audience of curious people who want to understand the world better.

**Not a goal (for now):** Monetization. This is a passion project first.
