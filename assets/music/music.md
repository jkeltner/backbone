# Backbone: Music Direction

## Usage Context
The theme music plays **immediately after the cold open** and before the longer intro. This means:
- Must hit hard from bar one — no slow build, no preamble
- Full energy within the first 2 bars
- Short: designed as a bumper/sting, not a long intro
- Will also need a trimmed 5–10 second version for wave transitions

---

## What Doesn't Work
- Slow cinematic builds (cello/strings swelling from nothing)
- Minimalist/sparse approaches (solo piano, ambient pads)
- Anything that takes more than 2–3 seconds to establish energy
- Generic corporate podcast sound
- Overly dark or tense (this isn't a true crime show)

## Direction: What We're Going For
Upbeat, high energy, hits immediately. Confident and forward-moving — the feeling that something important and exciting is about to be told. Intelligent without being dry. A strong melodic hook that listeners will recognize in two seconds.

Reference feel: heist movie energy, smart documentary that doesn't waste time, excited-smart-people-about-to-tell-you-something.

## Options Generated (ElevenLabs) — Keepers

### Option 1: Driving Brass + Big Beat
> *Upbeat, driving theme. Opens immediately with a bold brass hook — no intro, straight into the melody. Big punchy drums underneath, tight and rhythmic. Moderate-fast tempo (around 130 BPM). The energy is confident and forward-moving, like something important is about to happen. Melodic and memorable — a theme you recognize in two seconds. Tone: bold, intelligent, exciting. No slow build — full energy from bar one.*

### Option 2: Funk-Influenced Groove
> *Upbeat funk-influenced instrumental. Opens with a tight electric bass groove and punchy rhythm guitar stabs — immediate energy, no preamble. Horns punctuate the rhythm. Fast tempo, locked-in groove. Feels alive and propulsive — like smart people who are excited about what they're about to tell you. Tone: energetic, curious, slightly mischievous. Optimistic without being cheesy.*

### Option 4: Uptempo Orchestral Pop
> *Uptempo orchestral pop theme, fast tempo. Opens immediately with a bold string and brass hook over driving percussion. Punchy, rhythmic, melodic — combines the energy of a pop track with the weight of an orchestral arrangement. Think: exciting documentary score that doesn't waste time. Hits the full groove within the first two bars. Tone: epic but energetic, substantial but fun.*

### Option 6: Big Beat + Melodic Bassline
> *Upbeat, groove-driven instrumental built around a bold melodic bassline that hits from bar one. Punchy drums lock in underneath. A melodic synth or brass line weaves over the top. Fast, rhythmic, immediately memorable. Tempo around 125 BPM — fast enough to feel urgent, groove enough to feel fun. Tone: confident, distinctive, the kind of theme that listeners will recognize immediately. No slow intro — the bassline IS the hook.*
