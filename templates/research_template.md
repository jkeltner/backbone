## AI Research Limitations

*Remember when using this document:*
- Claims should be verified against primary sources, especially quotes
- AI knowledge has a cutoff—recent information needs independent verification
- AI may present plausible-sounding but incorrect information confidently
- Different sources may tell different versions; AI may pick one arbitrarily

**When in doubt, go to the primary source.**
