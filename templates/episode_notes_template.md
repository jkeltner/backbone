**Workflow:**

2. Pull in the best material here, add your own notes and connections
3. Trade ideas, reorganize, debate what to include
4. This becomes the brief for the script/outline

**What goes here:**
- What you definitely want to include
- Connections and throughlines you've identified
- Questions for each other
- Notes on tone, pacing, emphasis
- Ideas for how to present something

**What stays in raw research:**
- Exhaustive detail you might not use
- Source citations and verification notes
